# Search Filter

## Instruction

In this challenge, you're given an app that uses useEffect as a way to react to changes in the search term. That's not ideal â€“ useEffect should be used for synchronizing, not for reacting to changes in a value. Refactor the app to get rid of useEffect but keep the same functionality.

## Tasks

1. Render the list of items
2. Filter the list of items based on search term
3. Don't use useEffect
